## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Doing this project really helped me hone my css skills especially. I was able to figure out how to ensure the images fit in and also master responsiveness, using just html and vanilla css and Javascript. Of course, css grid and flexbox helped making this process easier.
